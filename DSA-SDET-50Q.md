## SPEED TARGETS (For 8+ Years Experience)

| Difficulty | Target Time | Reality Check |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Easy | 10 min | Should solve in <15 min |
| Medium | 25 min | Should solve in <35 min |
| Hard | 45 min | Should solve in <60 min |

**If exceeding targets:** Review similar patterns, optimize approach

---

## COMMON MISTAKES AT 8+ YEARS LEVEL

❌ **Jumping to code without approach** → Wasted 10 min on wrong solution
✅ **Spend 5 min on whiteboard approach first**

❌ **Not discussing complexity improvements** → Shows lack of depth
✅ **Always ask: Can we do better than O(n log n)?**

❌ **Ignoring edge cases** → Fails in final test
✅ **Always test: empty input, single element, duplicates, boundaries**

❌ **Not explaining trade-offs** → Seems inexperienced
✅ **Always mention: Time/space trade-off, why this pattern, alternatives**

---

## BONUS: PATTERN COMBINATIONS (Most Asked in Final Rounds)

| Combination | Q# | Difficulty |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| Sliding Window + DP | Q2, Q34 | Hard |
| Graph + Backtracking | Q22, Q40 | Hard |
| Heap + DP | Q26, Q36 | Hard |
| Tree + Graph | Q127, Q207 | Hard |

## FAQ FOR 8+ YEARS SDET

**Q: Should I memorize all solutions?**
A: No. Understand patterns. Can you identify Pattern A in 2 min? That's the goal.

**Q: Do I need to solve all 50?**
A: Yes. Each teaches unique optimization. Weak pattern = interview fail.

**Q: What if Hard questions take 90 min?**
A: Normal for first 5 days. Should reduce to 50-60 min by day 15.

**Q: Should I use solutions during learning?**
A: Try 30 min alone. Stuck? Read solution, understand, redo from scratch.

**Q: Most important pattern for SDET?**
A: DP + Trees (30% of rounds). Master those first (Days 6-15).
